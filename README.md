## Overview: 
  The game initiates with a Start button; the player has seven guesses to guess the correct Crystal Gem. Your previous
  guesses will be displayed and the game will alert you when trying to press a key that isn't a letter.
  
  Hints are displayed to the left in the form of a dark silhouette of each character, which is revealed as you get the answer. 
  When you guess correctly, a song associated with that character plays!
